    maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German, and his maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken, was a

    1991–1996: Career beginnings
    In 1991, DiCaprio played an un-credited role in one episode of Roseanne. He made his film debut later that year
    as the stepson of an evil landlord in the low-budget horror direct-to-video film Critters 3, a role he described as
    "your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair." DiCaprio prefers not to remember his role in Critters 3,
    which he describes as "possibly one of the worst films of all time. I guess it was a good example to look back and
    make sure it doesn't happen again." Later that year, he became a recurring cast member on the sitcom Growing
    Pains, playing Luke Brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the Seaver family. Costar Joanna Kerns recalls
    DiCaprio being "especially intelligent and disarming for his age" but also mischievous on set. The teenage
    DiCaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to the teenage female audiences, but when the show's ratings did not
    improve, DiCaprio left it. He was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actor Co-starring in a
    Television Series.
