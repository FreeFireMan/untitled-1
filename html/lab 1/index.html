    <span>Adam Richard Sandler (born September 9, 1966) is an American actor, comedian, and filmmaker.
        He was a cast member on
        Saturday Night Live from 1990 to 1995, before going on to star in many Hollywood films,
        which have combined to earn
        more than $2 billion at the box office.
        Sandler's comedic roles include Billy Madison (1995), Happy Gilmore (1996),
        The Waterboy (1998), The Wedding Singer (1998), Big Daddy (1999), Mr. Deeds (2002),
        50 First Dates (2004), The Longest Yard (2005), Click (2006), Grown Ups (2010), Just Go with It (2011),
        Grown Ups 2 (2013), Blended (2014), Murder Mystery (2019) and Hubie Halloween (2020).
        He also voices Dracula in the Hotel Transylvania franchise (2012–present).

        Some of his films, mainly comedy films such as Jack and Jill (2011), have been widely panned,
        and Sandler is the holder of nine Golden Raspberry Awards and 37 Raspberry Award nominations,
        more than any other actor but Sylvester Stallone. Conversely, he has earned praise for his dramatic performances in films such as Punch-Drunk Love (2002), Spanglish (2004), Reign Over Me (2007), Funny People (2009), The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected) (2017), and Uncut Gems (2019).

<h2 id="career"> Career</h2>
<p>
    Early in his career, in 1987, Sandler played Theo Huxtable's friend, Smitty, in The Cosby Show and the Stud Boy or
    Trivia Delinquent in the MTV game show Remote Control. After his film debut Going Overboard in 1989, Sandler
    performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by
    comedian Dennis Miller, who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to Saturday Night Live producer
    Lorne Michaels. Sandler was hired as a writer for SNL in 1990 and became a featured player the following year,
    making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "The Thanksgiving Song" and
    "The Chanukah Song". Sandler told Conan O'Brien on The Tonight Show that NBC fired him and Chris Farley from the
    show in 1995, and played this up in his return to the show as a host in 2019.

    In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film Coneheads with Chris Farley, David Spade, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, and
    Jane Curtin. In 1994, he co-starred in Airheads with Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi.
